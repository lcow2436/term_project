                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2010, KSharp started with a simple mission: to revolutionize the way people sharpen
                    their knives. It all began when our founder, Vishwas Singhi, a passionate chef and knife
                    enthusiast, realized the frustration of using dull knives in the kitchen.</p>
                <p>Determined to find a solution, Vishwas Singhi embarked on a journey to create the perfect knife
                    sharpener - one that is easy to use, versatile, and delivers exceptional results every time.
                    After years of research, development, and testing, KSharp was born.</p>
                <p>Since then, we have been committed to providing our customers with the highest quality sharpening
                    solutions, backed by innovation, expertise, and dedication to customer satisfaction. Our journey
                    is not just about sharpening knives; it's about enhancing the culinary experience and empowering
                    chefs and home cooks to unleash their creativity in the kitchen.</p>
                <p>Today, KSharp is proud to be a trusted name in the world of knife sharpening, serving customers
                    around the globe with our innovative products and unparalleled service. As we continue to grow
